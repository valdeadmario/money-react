This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
Its my first ReactApp:)

## Money Control

This project created with React and for styling using Bootstrap.
I use here new React features such as:

- Higher-Order Components
- Component LifeCycle
- Render function
- props.children

## About App
In this App you can add your income and expense money.
If you add new income or expense, App recalculating total budget and income or expense budget.
Also you can watch percentage of your expense
```$xslt
percentage = (income / expense) * 100%
```
Good luck:)
